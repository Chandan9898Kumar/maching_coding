### System Design Approach

In the context of front end system design interviews, the systems you are asked to design tend to be products, so we'll refer to the system as "product" from here on. Start by understanding the Requirements, defining the high level Architecture and the Data Model. Then define the Interfaces between the components in the product and talk about any Optimizations or dive deep into specific areas which require special attention.


### What is RADIO about?

1. `Requirements exploration:` Understand the problem thoroughly and determine the scope by asking a number of clarifying questions


**After Requirements exploration : Tell interviewer about your Tech choices**

`Example :`
    1. Library / Framework you are going to pick to build this App / Feature.
    2. State Management.
    3. Folder Structure.
    4. packages.
    5. Dependencies
    6. Design System ( MUI )
    7. Build tools ( Webpack, Rollup, Parcel )

2. `Architecture / High-level design:` Identify the key components of the product and how they are related to each other

3. `Data model / Core entities:` Describe the core entities and its data â€“ the fields each entity contains and which component(s) they belong to

4. `Interface definition (API):` Define the interface (API) between components in the product, functionality of each API, their parameters and responses

5. `Optimizations and deep dive: `Discuss possible optimization opportunities and specific areas of interest when building the product
Requirements exploration



**Requirements exploration**

`Objective:` Understand the problem thoroughly and determine the scope by asking a number of clarifying questions.

1. Some general questions you should get answers to before moving on to the next part of the interview:

> What are the main use cases we should be focusing on?

    A. Imagine you were asked to "Design Facebook". Facebook is a huge platform, there's news feed, profiles, friends, groups, stories, and more. Which parts of Facebook should you focus on? The interviewer has the answer in mind but wants you to find out by asking questions. Typically you should focus on the most unique aspects of the product, the features which define it. For Facebook, it would be the news feed, pagination of the feed, and creating new posts. For YouTube, it would be the video-watching experience. The important areas for other type of products be found in the types of questions.


2. What are the `functional requirements and non-functional requirements?`
Firstly, what are functional and non-functional requirements?

###                      Functional requirements

`Functional requirements:` Basic requirements of the product such that the product cannot function without them. This is usually whether a user can complete the core flows correctly.


Functional requirements specify what the system should do. They describe the features ( Search, add/remove product, products details,reviews ), functionalities, and behaviors of the system. In the context of a frontend design system, functional requirements might include:

1. `User Interface Components:`
    Buttons, forms, modals, navigation bars, etc.

2. `User Interactions:`
    How users interact with the UI (e.g., click events, hover effects).

3.` Data Handling:`
    How data is fetched, displayed, and manipulated (e.g., API calls, state management).

4. `Accessibility Features:`
    Compliance with accessibility standards (e.g., ARIA roles, keyboard navigation).

5. `Responsive Design:`
    Adaptation of UI components to different screen sizes and devices.

6. `Theming and Customization:`
    Options for users to customize the look and feel of the application.

7. `Error Handling:`
    How the system responds to errors (e.g., validation messages, error pages).



`When discussing functional requirements in a front-end system design interview, you need to clearly understand what the application needs to do from the user's perspective. Here are key questions you should ask to gather comprehensive functional requirements:`

*Core Functionality Questions*

1. `User Interactions`

    "What are the primary actions users will perform with this application?"

    "What are the key user journeys/flows we need to support?"

    "What specific interactions should trigger state changes or API calls?"

2. `Feature Scope`

    "What are the must-have features for the MVP (Minimum Viable Product)?"

    "What features are considered nice-to-have but not essential?"

    "Are there any features planned for future phases that we should design for now?"

3. `User Roles and Permissions`

    "What different types of users will interact with the application?"

    "What actions are specific to certain user roles?"

    "How should the UI adapt based on user permissions?"

4. `Content and Data Display`

    "What specific data needs to be displayed to users?"

    "How should this data be organized and presented?"

    "Are there any specific sorting, filtering, or search capabilities required?"

5. `Form Handling`

    "What forms will users need to complete?"

    "What validation rules apply to user inputs?"

    "What happens after form submission (success/failure flows)?"

6. `Navigation and Information Architecture`

    "How will users navigate between different sections of the application?"

    "What is the hierarchy of information in the application?"

    "Are there any specific routing requirements or URL structures needed?"

7. `Feedback and Notifications`

    "What types of feedback should be provided to users after actions?"

    "Are there any notification requirements (alerts, toasts, etc.)?"

    "How should errors be communicated to users?"

8. `State Transitions`

    "What are the different states each view can be in (loading, error, empty, populated)?"

    "How should transitions between these states be handled?"

    "Are there any complex multi-step processes that need state management?"

*Integration Questions*


9. `Backend Dependencies`

    "What backend services will the front-end need to interact with?"

    "Are there existing API contracts we need to adhere to?"

    "What data will be needed from the backend for each view?"

10. `Third-Party Integrations`

    "Are there any third-party services or APIs we need to integrate with?"

    "What authentication mechanisms are required for these integrations?"

    "Are there any rate limits or usage constraints we need to consider?"

11. `Authentication and Authorization`

    "What authentication method will be used (OAuth, JWT, etc.)?"

    "How should authenticated vs. unauthenticated states be handled?"

    "What happens when a user's session expires?"

*Questions to Ask for Functional Requirements:*
    1. What specific features must the system provide?
    2. How should users interact with the system?
    3. What data needs to be displayed, and how should it be structured?
    4. Are there any specific accessibility requirements?
    5. What are the expected user flows and scenarios?
    6. How should the system handle errors and exceptions?
    7. What are the core features to focus on and which are good-to-have?
    8. What devices/platforms (desktop/tablet/mobile) need to be supported?
    9. Is offline support necessary?
   10. Who are the main users of the product?
   11. Which browsers should we support?
   12. Do we need to support internationalization? (i18n)


###                    Non-functional requirements 


`Non-functional requirements:` Requirements that are viewed as improvements to the product, but not strictly required for the product to be usable, i.e. the product can still be used without these. These include performance (how fast the page loads, how fast an interaction takes), scalability (how many items can be present on the page before the page slows to a crawl), good user experience, etc.


Non-functional requirements define how the system performs its functions. They focus on the quality attributes of the system. In a frontend design system, non-functional requirements might include:



1. Performance
    Load times, responsiveness, and smoothness of interactions.

2. Scalability:
    Ability to handle increased load or user traffic.

3. Usability:
    Ease of use and learning curve for users.

4. Maintainability:
    How easy it is to update and maintain the codebase.

5. Security:
    Protection against vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF).

6. Compatibility:
    Support for different browsers and devices.

7. Localization and Internationalization:
    Support for multiple languages and regional settings.



> OR


These define HOW the system should perform. Non-functional requirements include things like:

1. Performance ( Performance optimization example using memoization,Callback,Code splitting etc. )
2. Security:
3. Accessibility (Internationalization, Keyboard ,Screen Reader, Contrast Etc.).
4. Responsiveness.
5. Error Handling.
6. Loading States.
7. Browser Compatibility.
8. SEO Requirements.
9. Reliability.
10. Maintainability.
11. Caching.

13. Availability ( Offline Support )





`Ask your interviewer these questions to better understand the non-functional requirements:`

1. What is the scale of the system?
2. How many users should it support?
3. How many requests should the server handle?
4. Are most use cases read-only?
5. Do users typically read the data shortly after someone else overwrites it?
6. Are most users on mobile devices?
7. What are the performance benchmarks we need to meet?
8. How will we ensure the system is scalable?
9. What usability standards should we adhere to?
10. How will we ensure the system is maintainable over time?
11. What security measures need to be implemented?
12. cWhich browsers and devices must the system support?
13. Are there any localization requirements for different regions?
14. Offline Functionality
    a. "Does the application need to work offline?"
    b. "What features should be available without an internet connection?"
    c. "How should data synchronization work when connection is restored?"

15. Internationalization and Localization
    a. "Will the application support multiple languages?"
    b. "Are there any right-to-left (RTL) language requirements?"
    c.  "How should date formats, currencies, and other locale-specific content be handled?"
    d. "Will the application support multiple languages?"
    e. "Are there any right-to-left (RTL) language requirements?"
    f. "How should date formats, currencies, and other locale-specific content be handled?"

16. Accessibility Requirements
    a. "What level of accessibility compliance is required (WCAG A, AA, AAA)?"
    b. "Are there specific accessibility features that need special attention?"
    c. "How should screen readers and keyboard navigation be supported?"

17. Device and Browser Support
    a. "What devices and screen sizes must be supported?"
    b. "What browsers and browser versions need to be supported?"
    c. "Are there any specific mobile or tablet requirements?"


`NOTE : ` At the very minimum, your design has to meet the functional requirements. After meeting all the function requirements, move on to talk about how to fulfill the non-functional requirements.



**Architecture / High-level design**

Architecture for front end interviews are typically focused on the client-side architecture, and not on large scale distributed systems where databases, load balancers and servers are involved.

For components, list down the various subcomponents that will exist within it and what data is being passed among each component.


`Objective:` Identify the key components of the product and how they are related to each other.



With the requirements in mind, we can move on to the architecture design proper. Your next task is to come up with a product/system architecture by identifying the key components of the product, how the components interact with each other, and how they are related. Remember to focus on the client-side architecture, not the back end.

Diagrams are your friends here. Each component can be represented using a rectangle and your high-level design usually ends up looking like a few rectangular boxes with arrows between them to demonstrate the flow of data. It is also possible to have components within components, in that case, draw the parent using bigger rectangles since they need to fit multiple subcomponents.


Examples of components/modules which are commonly found in a high-level front end design:

    1. `Server:` In front end system design interviews, we can treat the server as a black box and assume it exposes some APIs you can call via HTTP/WebSockets.

    2. `View:` This represents what the user sees, and it usually contains smaller subviews within it. Can contain client-side only state.

    3. `Controller:` The module which responds to user interactions and processes the data from the store/model in a format the view expects. This module is not always needed if the application is small and there's not much passing of data between modules.

    4. `Model/Client store:` Where the data lives. Stores contain data which will be presented to the user via views and stores tend to be app-wide in an interview context. In reality, you can have multiple stores within an application and stores can contain other stores.

Other things to consider when defining the responsibilities of components:

    1. `Separation of concerns:` Components are meant to be modular and serve to encapsulate a set of functionality and data. Consider the purpose/functionality of each component, what data it should contain and how it can service the rest of the system (what it can do for the other components).

    2. `Where computation should occur:` If some amount of computation is needed (e.g. filtering of results given a search term, calculating the total amount for a cart), should the work be done on the server or the client? There are tradeoffs to each approach and the decision is both product-dependent and context-dependent.



It is important to realize that not every common component mentioned above will be relevant and necessary for every product, it depends on the unique aspects of the product.

After drawing out the architecture diagram, verbally describe the responsibilities of each component (box in the diagram).



`When discussing architecture in a front-end system design interview, you need to focus on how the application will be structured, what patterns will be used, and how different components will interact. Here are key questions you should ask to develop a comprehensive architectural approach:`


1. `Overall Architecture Pattern`
    a. "What architectural pattern would be most appropriate for this application (MVC, MVVM, Flux, etc.)?"

    b. "Should we use a monolithic or micro-frontend approach?"

    c. "Would a component-based architecture be suitable for this application?"

2. `Component Hierarchy`
    a. "What should be the component hierarchy for this application?"
    b. "How granular should our components be?"
    c. "Which components should be stateful vs. stateless?"

3. `State Management`
    a. "What state management approach is most appropriate (Redux, Context API, MobX, etc.)?"
    b. "Should state be centralized or distributed across components?"
    c. "How will we handle global vs. local state?"

4. `Routing and Navigation`
    a. "What routing strategy should we implement?"
    b. "How will we handle nested routes and route parameters?"
    c. "Should we implement code-splitting at the route level?"

5. `Data Fetching Strategy`
    a. "What data fetching pattern should we use (fetch on render, fetch then render, render as fetch)?"
    b. "Should we implement a data layer/service layer?"
    c. "How will we handle caching of API responses?"

**Data model**

Data model for components will refer to the component state. The concept of state should be familiar to most front end developers who have used front end UI libraries/frameworks such as React, Angular, Vue, Svelte, etc. In every of these libraries/frameworks, state is a common concept.

Deciding what data to put in state is essential to doing well for this portion. Few factors to consider when deciding what goes into component state:

    1. State is allowed to change over time during the lifecycle of the component, typically as a result of user interactions.

    2. Each component should maintain its own independent state which allows multiple instances of the component to coexist on a single page. The state of a component instance should not affect the state of another instance.

    3. Components are easier to reason about (read/understand) the fewer the fields there are in the state. We should strive to reduce the amount of state needed. If a component uses a value which can be derived from another piece of state, then that value should most likely not be part of the state. For example if your component is rendering a list of items and you want to display a message when there are no items to render, there shouldn't be an additional isEmpty state because it can be derived from the length of the items.

    4. If a component has multiple subcomponents, it'll be best if it's possible to consolidate the state within the top level and the rest of the components are pure and stateless.


`Objective:` Describe the various data entities, the fields they contain and which component(s) they belong to.


We now have to think about what data fields are present in the client. There are two kinds of data on client applications:

1. `Server-originated data`
Data that originates from the server, usually from a database and meant to be seen by multiple people or accessed from multiple different devices. Common examples include user data (name, profile picture) and user-generated data (feed posts, comments).

2. `Client-only data`
Client-only data, also commonly known as state, is data that only needs to live on the client and does not have to be sent to the server for writing into the database. Client data can be further broken down into two:

    A. Data to be persisted: Usually user input such as data entered into form fields. These data usually has to be sent to the server and saved into a database for it to be useful.

    B. Ephemeral data: Temporary state that lasts for a short time. Common examples include form validation state, current navigation tab, whether a section is expanded, etc. It's usually acceptable to lose these data when the browser tab is closed.


When listing the data fields, it'd be useful to identify what kind of data that field is, whether it's server-originated data or client-only data

Depending on how far you progress along in the question and how the requirements have evolved and grown during the interview, you might need to add more fields. It's a dynamic and iterative process.

You might want to write these fields near the components which owns them in your architecture diagram.


`When discussing data models in a front-end system design interview, you need to focus on how data will be structured, managed, and flow through your application. Here are the key considerations and questions to ask:`


**Key Considerations in Data Model Design**

1. `Component State Management`
    a. What data needs to be stored in each component?

    b. Which state management approach is appropriate (local state, context, Redux, etc.)?

    c. How will state be shared between components?

2. `Data Types and Structures`

    a. What are the primary entities in the application?

    b. What properties/fields does each entity have?

    c. What are the relationships between different data entities?

3. `Data Flow`

    a. How does data flow between components?

    b. Where should data transformations happen?

    c. How will you handle derived state?

4. `Data Persistence`

    a. What data needs to be persisted locally (localStorage, sessionStorage)?

    b. What data is server-originated vs. client-only?

    c. How will you handle offline capabilities if needed?

5. `Data Synchronization`

    a. How will you keep client and server data in sync?

    b. How will you handle optimistic updates?

    c. What's the strategy for conflict resolution?

**Questions to Ask as a Front-End Developer**

1. `About Data Sources`

    "What are the primary data entities we need to work with?"

    "Where does the data originate from? APIs, user input, or both?"

    "What's the expected response format from the backend APIs?"

2. `About State Management`

    "How complex is the state management requirement? Do we need a global state solution?"

    "Which components need to share state, and which can maintain isolated state?"

    "Are there any performance concerns with the amount of data we'll be handling?"

3. `About Data Flow`

    "How frequently will the data change? Do we need real-time updates?"

    "What's the expected user flow, and how does that impact data requirements?"

    "Are there any complex data transformations needed between API responses and UI display?"

4. `About Caching and Performance`

    "What data should be cached on the client side?"

    "How long should cached data be considered valid?"

    "Are there any large data sets that might require pagination or virtualization?"

5. `About Data Validation`

    "What validation rules need to be applied to user inputs?"

    "Should validation happen on the client side, server side, or both?"

    "How should validation errors be communicated to users?"

6. `About Error Handling`

    "How should we handle API failures or data loading errors?"

    "What fallback data should be displayed when primary data is unavailable?"

    "Are there any specific error states we need to account for?"

7. `About Data Security`

    "Is there any sensitive data that requires special handling?"

    "Are there any data privacy concerns we need to address?"

    "What authentication/authorization requirements impact our data model?"

8. `About Scalability`

    "How might the data model need to evolve as the application grows?"

    "Are there any foreseeable changes to the data structure we should plan for?"

    "How will our data model handle increasing amounts of data?"


*Interface definition (API)*


`Objective:` Define the interface between components in the product, functionality of the various APIs, their parameters and responses.


The key idea behind components is for them to be reused and abstract complexities. Good components are designed in a way that they can be reused in multiple scenarios, and users do not have to know how they work internally before using them. In the case of components, API refers to configuration options that the component developer would expose to other developers for specification.

1. What are the configuration options you would allow for the component? (props in React). What would be reasonable defaults?

2. Follow the Open-closed principle - the component should be open for extension but closed for modification.

3. If your component is meant to be part of a UI library that doesn't bother about the appearance and leaves the styling to the user, extra care has to go into the design of the props and to allow users to customize the look and feel of the components.
There are a few ways to go about this in React:
    1. Composition - Props which accept React components which also promotes code reuse.

    2. Render props are function props that a component uses to know what to render. It also helps in reusing behavior without bothering about the appearance.

    3. className or style props - Allows users to inject class names and/or styling attributes to inner DOM elements. This could have negative consequences but is still a common way of allowing user to customize component appearance.

4. Possible configuration options:
    1. Lifecycle/event hooks - onClick, onChange, onBlur, onFocus, etc.



. With the components and data within each components, we can move on to discuss the interface (APIs) between the components. API is an overloaded term and generally refer to the protocol which software components communicate and request/send data between components. Client and server communicate via network layer APIs (HTTP/WebSockets). Client components generally communicate via functions in the browser runtime. 


`In frontend high-level design, an interface definition (API) refers to the explicit specification of how different components or systems communicate with each other. It defines the contract between the frontend (client-side) and backend (server-side) or between UI components themselves. This includes:`

1. Endpoints and Methods: The URLs and HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) that the frontend will use to interact with backend services.

2. Data Formats: The structure of requests and responses, typically JSON or XML.

3. Parameters and Configuration: Inputs the frontend can send (query parameters, headers, body data) and expected outputs.

4. Functionality: What each API call does-fetching data, submitting forms, updating resources, etc.

5. Error Handling: How errors are communicated and managed.

In component design (e.g., React), the API also refers to the componentâ€™s props or configuration options exposed to other developers for reuse without exposing internal complexity



`Interface definition in front-end system design refers to establishing clear contracts between different parts of your application. This includes defining how components communicate with each other, how the front-end interacts with back-end services, and how developers can use and extend your components. A well-defined interface is crucial for creating maintainable, reusable, and scalable front-end architectures.`


*Types of Interfaces in Front-End Development*


1. `Component Interfaces`
Component interfaces define how components communicate with each other and how they can be used by developers. This includes:

    1. Props/Inputs: The data and callbacks a component accepts

    2. Events/Outputs: The events or data a component emits

    3. Slots/Children: How a component can be extended with custom content

    4. Public Methods: Functions exposed for parent components to call



2. `Service Interfaces`
Service interfaces define how the application interacts with data sources and business logic:

    1. API Client Services: How the front-end communicates with back-end APIs

    2. State Management Services: How components access and modify shared state

    3. Utility Services: How components access common functionality


3. `External API Interfaces`
These define how your front-end interacts with external systems:

    1. REST/GraphQL APIs: Endpoints, request/response formats, authentication

    2. WebSocket Interfaces: Event types, message formats, connection handling

    3. Third-Party Library Interfaces: How your code interacts with external libraries


*Questions to Ask When Defining Interfaces*

1. `Component Interface Questions`
    "What props should this component accept, and which should be required vs. optional?"

    "What events should this component emit to its parent?"

    "How can developers extend or customize this component's behavior?"

    "What are reasonable default values for optional props?"

    "How will this component handle invalid prop values?"

2. `API Interface Questions`
    "What endpoints will the front-end need to interact with?"

    "What request/response formats should be used?"

    "How should authentication and authorization be handled?"

    "What error formats should be standardized across APIs?"

    "How will versioning be handled for API changes?"

3. `State Management Interface Questions`
    "What actions can modify the application state?"

    "How will components access shared state?"

    "What patterns will be used for asynchronous state updates?"

    "How will we handle derived state and memoization?"

4. `Cross-Component Communication Questions`
    "How will deeply nested components communicate with each other?"

    "Should we use events, callbacks, or a state management solution?"

    "How will we avoid prop drilling in the component hierarchy?"


*Optimizations and deep dive*


`Objective:` Discuss about possible optimization opportunities and specific areas of interest when building the product.


1. User experience (UX) :

    UX might not fall squarely under engineering but good front end engineers have good understanding of UX and building UI with great UX. There are too many UX practices to be aware of, but the most common ones/low hanging fruits are:

    1. Reflect state of the component to the user - If there's a pending background request, show a spinner. If there's an error, make sure to display it instead of silently failing.

    2. Display an empty state if there are no items in a list, instead of not rendering anything.

    3. Destructive actions should have a confirmation step, especially irreversible ones.

    4. Disable interactive elements if they trigger an async request! Prevents double firing of events in the case of accidental double clicking (possible for people with motor disabilities).

    5. If there are search inputs involved, each keystroke should not fire a network request.

    6. Handle extreme cases
        a. Strings can be really long/short and your UI should not look weird in either case. For long strings, they can have their contents truncated and hidden behind a "View more" button.

        b. If there are many items to display within a component, they shouldn't all be displayed on the screen at once and making the page extremely long/wide. Paginate the items or contain them within a container with a maximum width/height.

    7. Keyboard friendliness - This involves making sure the component is keyboard-friendly
        a. Add shortcuts to make the component more usable by keyboard-only users
        b. Ensure that elements can be focused and tab order within the component is correct

2. Performance

In front end, performance typically refers to a few things - loading speed, how fast the UI responds to user interactions, memory space (heap) required by the component.


    1. `Loading speed:` The less JavaScript the component contains, the less JavaScript the browser has to download to load the component and the lower the network request time. It's also important to modularize components and allow users to download only the necessary JavaScript modules needed for their use case.

    2. `Responsiveness to user interactions.`
        a. If a user interaction results in displaying of data that has to be loaded over the network, there will be a delay between the user interaction and updating of the UI. Minimizing that delay or removing it entirely is the key to improving responsiveness.

        b. JavaScript in a browser is single-threaded. The browser can only do execute one line of code at any one time. The less work (JavaScript executed, DOM updates) the component has to do when a user does something on the page, the faster the component can update the UI to respond to the changes.

    3. `Memory space:` The more memory your component takes up on the page, the slower the browser performs and the experience will feel sluggish/janky. If your component has to render hundreds/thousands of items (e.g. number of images in a carousel, number of items in a selector), memory space might become significant.



3. Optimization tips.

    1. Render only what is displayed on the screen.
    2. Lazy loading/load only necessary data.
    3. Preloading/prefetching data ahead of time


4. Accessibility (a11y)
Accessibility (a11y) is the practice of making your websites usable by as many people as possible.

    1. Color contrasts (e.g. color blindness)
    2. Keyboard friendliness (e.g. people with limited fine motor control)
    3. Visual Impairment (e.g. blind)
    4. Transcripts for audio (e.g. deaf)

5. Internationalization (i18n).
Internationalization (i18n) is the design and development of a product, application or document content that enables easy localization for target audiences that vary in culture, region, or language.


6. Multi-device support
Is the component expected to be used on mobile web? Mobile devices have unique constraints - they have less powerful hardware and viewport size is smaller. Hence things could be done differently to allow the component to work better on mobile devices - making a conscious effort to:

    1. Not use too much memory - using too much memory makes the device perform slower
    2. Increasing the hit box of interactive elements - fingers have an easier time tapping on the right element


7. Security
Most of the time, components aren't exposed to security vulnerabilities, but it can still happen. Here are the more common security vulnerabilities you should be aware of:

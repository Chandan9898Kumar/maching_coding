###  POLY-FILLS


### 1. Write polyfills for the call(), apply(), and bind() methods in JavaScript.

- NOTE : The call(), apply() and bind() methods are used for function borrowing in JavaScript. It means that by using them, we can use the methods of one object on a different object without having to make a copy of that method and maintain it in two separate places.
